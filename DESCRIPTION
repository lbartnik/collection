Description: If storing and easily accessing multiple R objects are
  important in whatever you are doing, this package can speed-up these
  tasks. It implements a simple, file-system based object storage,
  and a number of functions to distribute computational tasks performed
  on these objects across a cluster. Plus a few methods to make working
  with collections as close to interactive as possible.
