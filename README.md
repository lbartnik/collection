# collection
Object-centered persistent-storage collection for R 

Top-priority goal is to reduce the time required to move from an idea
of an algorithm/ML model to its implementation and testing.

Store objects of any kind in file system, process them in parallel
in the current or in a remote R session and store the results back
in the file system.
