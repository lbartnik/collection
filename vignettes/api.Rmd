```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(collection)
library(knitr)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>")
```


## Basic verbs

```{r}
c <- collection('objects')
```

All functions described below as their first argument take one of:

* a `collection`
* a `clist`


`filter()` accepts a number of conditional expressions to be evaluated
on tags. It filters out objects for which at least one expression
evaluates to `FALSE`.

```{r}
filter
```


`arrange()` changes the order of objects.

```{r}
arrange
```


`apply()` calls a given function on each object. It returns a computational
task that by default is evaluated in the current session.

```{r}
apply
```


`compute()` evaluates a computation task.

```{r}
compute(task, where)
```
