```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(collection)
library(knitr)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>")
```



## Basics

First we create a collection and store an object in it.

```{r}
x <- collection('objects')
store(x, iris)
```


Let's a summary of `x` and then list objects stored there:

```{r}
print(x)
show(x)
```


Finally, let's read that object back:

```{r}
restore(x, 'id')
```


## Multiple Objects

```{r}
library(tibble)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
```


### A Linear Model: Manual Steps

What if we have multiple objects we'd like to work with? What if they
share a common data layout and while we explore models with a few of
them, we'd later like to apply or verify the best-model-so-far on all
of them?

A good example could be **time series**. Let's say we have a data set
with the main time series plus a number of other secondary series that
we suspect could be handy in making prediction with the main one. How
can we approach that?

First, we load these data sets into a collection. Let's say there is a
number of files whose names define an `id` for each time series.

```{r}
input_files <-
  system.file('time-series', package = 'collection') %>%
  list.files('.*rds', full.names = TRUE)

multiple <- collection('multiple')

lapply(input_files, function (path) {
  data <- readRDS(path) %>% tibble::tibble
  id   <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(path))
  store(multiple, data, data_id = id)
})
```

Now that we have all these files in a collection we can try and build
a predictive model for one of them. At this point we don't have a
strong preference so we take the first object in the collection.

```{r}
data <- restore(multiple[1])
```

Instead of using advance time series techniques we will start with
a simple linear model - we will curate the input data set, however,
by adding a few lags. Then we split the data set into training and
testing sets, and build the first model.

```{r}
data %<>%
  mutate(x_1 = lag(x, 1), x_2 = lag(x, 2), x_3 = lag(x, 3))

train <- head(data, -1)
test  <- tail(data, 1)

m <- lm(x ~ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + a + b + c, data = train)
```

Let's see how well it does on the testing set.

```{r}
test$pred_x <- predict(m, data = test)
with(test, abs(pred_x - x)/x)
```

We can wrap it up in a single function whose parameters are the input
data set and the split row.

```{r}
build_and_test_simple_lm <- function (data, n)
{
  data %<>%
    mutate(x_1 = lag(x, 1), x_2 = lag(x, 2), x_3 = lag(x, 3))

  train <- head(data, -n)
  test  <- tail(data, n)

  m <- lm(x ~ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + a + b + c, data = train)
  test$pred_x <- predict(m, data = test[, 1])
  
  with(test, abs(pred_x - x)/x)
}
```


### Linear Model: Run on all Data Sets

What if we would like to see how does our model do on the rest of the
data sets? Nothing simpler than that!

```{r}
results <-
  multiple %>%
  lapply(build_and_test_simple_lm, n = 1)

results
```
